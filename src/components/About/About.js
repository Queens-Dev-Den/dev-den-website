                    The Dev Den is a place for computing students to hangout and work on projects
                    together. We get together weekly, and people collaborate with each other on their
                    personal projects. Have an idea for a project but you don't think you can handle 
                    it alone? The Dev Den is the place for you. Want to gain experience working on a 
                    project with others but you don't know of any group projects you can join? The 
                    Dev Den is the place for you. Want to come hangout with other computing students 
                    and brainstorm your next awesome project? The Dev Den. The club is open to all 
                    Queen's computing students all year round, so anyone can join anytime and help 
                    others with their projects or start their own. We also hld monthly informal 
                    hackathons where our members can show off the projects they have been working on 
                    and get to see everyone else's projects. The goal of the Dev Den is to provide a 
                    casual environment for computing students to hangout, develop their skills and 
                    expand their portfolios. The Dev Den creates an amazing opportunity for students 
                    to learn from other students while working on projects that will shine on their 
                    resumes.
